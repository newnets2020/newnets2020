	<b>Edge Intelligence for IoT & Emerging Trends</b><br>
				<b>Keith Nolan, Principal Engineer, Centre for Intelligent Power, Eaton, Dublin, Ireland</b>
				<br>
	<br>	
				<b>Abstract</b><br>
				The Internet of Things concept is evolving.  Computation and intelligence are moving between the cloud right to the very edges of a network. Acting on data where and when they are produced enables faster decision making and control. Connecting assets helps make machines more intelligent and aware of their environment. This talk will discuss the increasing range of wireless and wired communications and networking technologies used to connect assets ranging from low-power wide area (LPWA) to high-reliability wireless LAN and time-sensitive networking. Emerging trends including a massive increase in variety and volumes of devices and data, and an increased focus on revenue generation & cost optimisation will also be addressed. Sensing is becoming increasingly multimodal and media-driven. Real-time insights are required to support decision-control loops that operate in microsecond to millisecond timescales for mission-critical industrial control and processing. Edge intelligence and low-latency quality of service will support the next generation of immersive user experiences. Dr. Nolan will also discuss how moving computation to the edge helps to increase data privacy & security for user/enterprise and diverse geographies.
